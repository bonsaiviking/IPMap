    class IPMap(__builtin__.object)
     |  Base class for IPMap objects. Puts IP/value pairs into buckets and generates
     |  a Hilbert curve mapping of buckets to x/y coordinates.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __getitem__(self, bucket)
     |      Get the current value of a bucket
     |  
     |  __init__(self, cidr, resolution=256)
     |      Required argument *cidr* is the network mask in CIDR notation, e.g.
     |      192.168.1.0/24. Optional argument *resolution* is the number of buckets to
     |      sort the IPs into, and will be rounded up to the next highest square number
     |  
     |  __setitem__(self, bucket, value)
     |      Set the value of the bucket. Subclasses should override
     |      *update_value* instead.
     |  
     |  add(self, ip, value)
     |      Update the IPMap with a new IP and value
     |  
     |  bucket(self, ip)
     |      Get the bucket (0..resolution] that the IP belongs in
     |  
     |  build(self)
     |      Build and return the whole map. Assumes there are no more values to
     |      add, though the base class version is not destructive. Override this to
     |      generate different kinds of maps.
     |  
     |  points(self)
     |      Generator for iterating over the IPMap. Yields a 2-tuple of (x, y)
     |      and the value at that point, in Hilbert-curve order (a la turtle)
     |  
     |  update_value(self, bucket, new)
     |      Given a bucket, update its contents with the new value. Override this
     |      method to use a different algorithm than addition (the default)
     |  
     |  xy2ip(self, x, y)
     |      Given a set of x/y coordinates, return the lower bound of the IP
     |      addresses in the corresponding bucket

    class IPMapHtmlTable(IPMap)
     |  IPMap as an HTML table

     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  build(self, numclasses=10)
     |      Returns the map as HTML *<tr>* and *<td>* elements, suitable for
     |      including in the *<tbody>* element of a table. Text content is the base
     |      IP for each bucket, and the class is the return value of
     |      self.get_class(self[bucket]).
     |  
     |  get_class(self, num)
     |      Override to enum classes
